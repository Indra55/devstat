## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js (v18 or higher recommended) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/devstat.git
    cd devstat
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username if you fork this project.)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Usage

To start `devstat`, simply run:

```bash
node index.js
```

Follow the interactive prompts:
1.  Choose a platform (GitHub, LeetCode, Codeforces, or Compare Profiles).
2.  Enter the username(s) when prompted.

`devstat` will then fetch and display the profile information or comparison.

### GitHub Personal Access Token (Optional)

For higher GitHub API rate limits and to access private repository data (if applicable), you can set a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) as an environment variable named `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

1.  **Generate a PAT:** Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a new token. Grant it the necessary permissions (e.g., `repo` for private repos, `public_repo` for public repos).
2.  **Set the environment variable:**

    **Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    export GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_PAT_HERE"
    ```
    (Add this to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent for persistence)

    **Windows (Command Prompt):**
    ```cmd
    set GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_PAT_HERE"
    ```

    **Windows (PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
    $env:GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_PAT_HERE"
    ```

    *(Replace `YOUR_PAT_HERE` with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token.)*

#### Example: Fetching a GitHub Profile

```bash
node index.js
# Select 'GitHub'
# Enter your GitHub username (e.g., 'octocat')
```

#### Example: Comparing LeetCode Profiles

```bash
node index.js
# Select 'Compare Profiles'
# Select 'LeetCode'
# Enter first LeetCode username (e.g., 'user1')
# Enter second LeetCode username (e.g., 'user2')
```
